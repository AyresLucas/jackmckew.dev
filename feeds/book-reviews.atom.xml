&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of practical &amp;amp; insightful wisdom in this book is amazing, here I've noted down quotes from the book which make up a fantastic starting point for ensuring a negotiation goes smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prepare"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion - you fall to your highest level of preparation"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-goal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think through the best/worse case scenarios, but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summarize"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a "That's right", if they don't you haven't done it right"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="labels"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare 3 to 5 labels which can be used to extract information, or diffuse an accusation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"It seems like ____ is valuable to you"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"It seems like ____ makes it easier"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"It seems like you're reluctant to ____"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="calibrated-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calibrated Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prepare 3 to 5 calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify &amp;amp; overcome potential deal killers"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What are we trying to accomplish"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What's the core issue here"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What's the biggest challenge you face"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mirroring"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirroring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-and-how"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What and How&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ask calibrated questions that begin with 'What' or 'How'. By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="loss-aversion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realise a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees there is something to lose by inaction"&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Reviews"></category><category term="bookreview"></category><category term="principles"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review: Courage To Be Disliked</title><link href="https://jackmckew.dev/book-review-courage-to-be-disliked.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-04T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2020-03-04T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Jack McKew</name></author><id>tag:jackmckew.dev,2020-03-04:/book-review-courage-to-be-disliked.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;The courage to be disliked is a book around the work of a 19th century psychologist who determined that happiness lies within the individual and doesn't depend on the past whatsoever. I really enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it to anyone at all walks &amp;amp; stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;The courage to be disliked is a book around the work of a 19th century psychologist who determined that happiness lies within the individual and doesn't depend on the past whatsoever. I really enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it to anyone at all walks &amp;amp; stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is structured as a dialogue between a curious youth and a philosopher that the youth had sought out to answer some questions. This was intentional by the authors to try and answer questions that the reader could come up with while reading, I found this really effective and found myself having a question and then it immediately would come up moments later while reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I took out of this book was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparing yourself to others is only of detriment to your own mental health and well being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a dangerous belief in believing your past defines you &amp;amp; your future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition is mostly fictional and that life isn't a race, everyone walks their own path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people don't pay as much attention to you as you may possibly believe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All problems in the world are from interpersonal relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to take on anyone elses tasks, and not let anyone take on your tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't focus on the past or the future, focus on the here and now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the book is broken into five 'chapters' resembling separate nights in which the youth would visit the philosopher, discuss topics, leave with concepts to contemplate and return on the next night with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="first-night"&gt;First Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on the past helps nobody&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key point that I took away from this chapter was most things are generally explained in the world as a cause &amp;amp; effect. The standpoint of the psychologist is that rather than focusing on how something in the past affected an outcome, it's rather in the view point of the current goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter goes into an example of a recluse youth who wouldn't go out for anything, rather preferring to stay at home, inside. The youth argues that this could be due to his upbringing and things that had happened in the recluse's life, while the philosopher returns with the reasoning behind the recluse's nature is because of a possible current goal that person may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosopher argues that the recluse youth may desire attention and affection from their family, and thus by not going into the outside world, that protects the youths situation from changing. Putting it in the frame of which the reasoning is dependent on the current goal of the person in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="second-night"&gt;Second Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All problems are interpersonal relationship problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter I personally strongly agreed with. The viewpoint in which all problems derive from one human interaction with another and how this is closely tied with the 'feeling of inferiority' causing dilemmas in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resonate with the explanation of the feeling of inferiority being when one compares themself to another, and feels as though they are not equal and the other is superior in one form or another. All of these feeling of inferiority, while they are common, are subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognising these feelings as subjective, this puts the power to control how we perceive them in the hands of the individual. Although they can easily turn from inferiority to superiority, which can be as detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="third-night"&gt;Third Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't take on other people's tasks, and don't let other people take your tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter delved into a way of life in which one does not live to satisfy the expectations of others and a viewpoint which denies the desire for recognition for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts are portrayed through the situation in which a child tries to live up to the parents expectations, specifically the scenario where the child tries to live their life along the lines set by the parents. A common scenario of this is what to do for a living, where to go to school and many more factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychological concept to combat this is by denying to live by the expectations of others and not doing things for the sake of receiving recognition from others later on. By seeking the recognition of others, it is as if trying to satisfy the expectations of everyone which can only lead to disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you lead such a selfish life, will that not only cause more interpersonal relationship problems? The psychologist standpoint is this in to 'not behave without regards for others' and this is achieved through the separation of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="separation-of-tasks"&gt;Separation of tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept is portrayed through a child-parent relationship and the topic of studying. A common scenario for this is a heavy handed approach by forcing the child to study either by incentive or punishment, which inevitably may lead to the child resenting the practice which is perceived as favourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution that is presented is if the parent leaves the task in the child's responsibility, but only seeks to provide assistance, if and when the child seeks it. Which hopefully leads to the child seeing benefit in their own actions and enjoying a beneficial action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fourth-night"&gt;Fourth Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self value, horizontal relationships and individualism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="self-value"&gt;Self Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delving into a typical 'self-centred' viewpoint in which someone is the centre of their own world and the viewpoint in which everyone else is to live up to their expectations (detrimental as mentioned earlier), the philosopher attempts to present the standpoint of living for the benefit of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking at things with expectations for others, by living as if how your own personal actions can be of benefit for others subsequently can lead to a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="horizontal-relationships"&gt;Horizontal Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the concept of living for the benefit of the community (thus resolving interpersonal relationship problems) is achieved, this is further enhanced by the concept of horizontal relationships, wherein one is not above or below any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as one puts themself in a 'vertical' relationship, wherein one is believed to be superior/inferior to the other, this is only going to cause further interpersonal relationship problems and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By rather living as if everyone is equal, and lives to the benefit of others, this concentrates a fulfilling lifestyle and is beneficial for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fifth-night"&gt;Fifth Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live for the now, not the past or the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take in all the points &amp;amp; concepts raised above, this are only enhanced further when you take in the concept that the past &amp;amp; the future should not matter whatsoever on the actions you can change now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore by living for the moment, not letting the past be the cause and effect of who you are, living for the benefit of others and treating everybody equal, I find these great steps to leading a more fulfilling, happy life.&lt;/p&gt;

While it doesn't explicitly step the reader through how to change habits, it thoroughly goes through many examples of where habits have changed other people's lives, case studies if you will. By then being able to recognise the habitual changes these people had to make, this allows the reader to (maybe) identify and be able to change some of their own habits to better their own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cue-routine-reward"&gt;Cue, Routine, Reward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concept that is repeatedly drawn parallel to habitual behaviours in the case study examples is that of Cue, Routine, Reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cue: Something that 'triggers' a habitual behaviour, this could be hunger, boredom or even just a bright colour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routine: The process that follows the cue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: The end goal of this habit to satisfy a need/desire for something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this in my own life is that when I'm at work sitting at my desk tapping away at my jobs for the day, I'll finish one of my tasks for the day (I love bullet journalling to maintain these), I won't want to start the next task straight away so I'll typically go to the kitchen and fill up my drink bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cue: Finish a task at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routine: Walk to the kitchen and fill up water bottle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: A moment to stretch my legs and get a drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a good habit that I have tried to instill myself, can also be replaced by any bad habit (eg, walk to the kitchen and eat a bag of chips)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="case-study-alcoa"&gt;Case Study - Alcoa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic case study that was presented in the book that resonated with me was the changing of the CEO at Alcoa. Alcoa is one of the biggest manufacturers of aluminium in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the CEO had changed, Alcoa was a dangerous place to work with a high staff injury rate, turns out working with molten metal all day can be a dangerous activity, who would've knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new CEO made it his goal that the number 1 priority of Alcoa going forward would be safety. Profits, revenue, etc were not going to be the focus of Alcoa anymore (upsetting lots of investors at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing changes such as employees would be required to implement a new safety procedure to get a promotion and that no task was worth doing in an unsafe manner, the CEO had instilled a habit of safety into the culture of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ripple on effect of this was that by putting a focus on one aspect of the entire operation, this amended many of the things that were halting progress within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of machinery breaking down catastrophically and needing long repair times, equipment was being regularly maintained as to keep it in safe working order and producing more material. Workers that were needing to take lots of time off were now able to keep working now that they were not falling ill to injury's or sickness from the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead to Alcoa producing some of its best results in history and is a great example how focusing on one element of a business can have such a ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="michael-phelps"&gt;Michael Phelps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in Michael Phelps life, a coach realized Michael's potential as an athlete in swimming. This coach through instilling habits into Michael's routine, would go on to produce one of the most athletic swimmers of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By getting Michael to follow the exact same process (routine) every time before a race, this made it naturally for Michael to compete so strongly. Michael watched a video of the perfect race, every single time before a race, listened to the same pump up music through his headphones, stood up and waved to the crowd the exact same way every time such that it had became a habit to swim. Something that he didn't actively have to think about to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally absolutely loved this book and it's appreciation for that not every person works the same way. By presenting the reader with a multitude of case studies and allowing the reader to determine what might be effective in their life for themselves, this doesn't instruct the reader to learn how their habits work but rather allows them to see the world through a different lens.&lt;/p&gt;

To give some background, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Assosciates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, wrote this book around the unique principles …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just finished reading &lt;a href="https://www.principles.com/"&gt;Ray Dalio's book Principles&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to use this space to jot down some of my personal takeaways and thoughts. To give some background, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Assosciates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, wrote this book around the unique principles that he discovered through his over forty year career that led to his and Bridgewater's success. Dalio believes that it is these principles, that are the reason behind whatever success he has had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the thick of it, I would recommend this book to anyone that is feeling they are lacking some direction in their life. One of the organizational techniques I've picked up lately is &lt;a href="https://bulletjournal.com/"&gt;Bullet Journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the takeaways I got from the book was to start prioritizing my to-dos, in comparison to what I do now which is just dump it all onto the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is broken into two major sections: Life Principles and Work Principles, followed by descriptions of the tools developed to work alongside the principles to help keep the concept of an idea meritocracy intact. The concept of an idea meritocracy, is where you can have a community/company in which the best idea wins, no matter who/where it came from. This is in comparison to regular company structures where the decisions come from top down, which has its pros/cons as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="life-principles"&gt;Life Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 246, there is a summary of the life principles which are fully detailed in the preceding chapter. While I won't go into detail on Ray's perspective of the points, however I'll give a brief description on my personal takeaway. Please note the points are listed in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.1 - Be a hyperrealist - you need to understand, accept and work with reality to be able to appreciate and move forward with things effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.3 - Radical transparency - while this can be a tough habit to develop, it pays itself off time and time again for both yourself and the people around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.4 - Look to nature to learn how reality works - if you haven't noticed in my blog posts, I am extremely curious about the natural way of evolution and look to bring it's methods into my everyday life and projects. I believe that Dalio also appreciates the power of evolution and is integrating it into his work (as he later describes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 - 5 Step process to get what you want out of life&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of our achieving those goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design plans that will get you around them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 - Radical open mind - something that I have blogged about in the past, open mindedness, you can find that post here: &lt;a href="https://jackmckew.dev/episode-3-open-mind.html"&gt;https://jackmckew.dev/episode-3-open-mind.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.5 - Getting the right people in the right roles in support of your goal is the key to succeeding at whatever you choose to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5.10 - Believability weight your decision making - I believe when gathering opinions and thoughts on something, you must weight the opinions based upon how 'believable' the source is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="work-principles"&gt;Work Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalio believes that culture is the most important part of any organization. I also share the same perspective that any company consists of two major components: culture and people. If the culture isn't right, the right people won't stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.1 - Realize you have nothing to fear from knowing the truth - while sometimes harsh, having more information can always be beneficial if looked at from the right perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.1 - Recognize that mistakes are a natural part of the evolutionary process - keeping with the theme of evolution is one of the greatest things in nature, it must be accepted that mistakes are apart of it all and are inevitable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.2 - Don't worry about looking good, worry about achieving your goals - this is one that I try to embrace more and more each time I do something, admittedly at times I will withhold from sharing with others from how much progress has been made, by not sharing, everyone is losing out from sharing the learning experience as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.4 - Remember to reflect when you experience pain - it is always a good idea to look back on an experience that didn't go to plan or badly to make sure you adapt and evolve for next time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5.2 - Find the most believable people possible to disagree with you and try to understand their reasoning - a great way at validating your reasoning behind something is to ask someone else to poke holes through it to see if it still stands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the way that you perceive the points in this book is dependent on the stage of life that you are at personally. However, even reading through them now, while I can't resonate with them at this point in time, I am glad that they have planted the seed for later on, which may be of great assistance. That is why I believe you should read this book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Reviews"></category><category term="bookreview"></category><category term="principles"></category><category term="habits"></category></entry></feed>
