**Resources & tips for getting started in Python**

## Glossary
One of the most useful skills in my opinion in all walks of life is the ability to find information & answers. A very useful tool for doing this is the internet & search engines like Google. In my opinion being able to search the internet for answers to your programming questions is a skill in itself, knowing the right words or phrases to use is a massive part of that, so I will begin with a glossary of terminology for things that may make it easier to answer your questions.
