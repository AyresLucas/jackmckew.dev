**Resources & tips for getting started in Python**

## Glossary
One of the most useful skills in my opinion in all walks of life is the ability to find information & answers. A very useful tool for doing this is the internet & search engines like Google. In my opinion being able to search the internet for answers to your programming questions is a skill in itself, knowing the right words or phrases to use is a massive part of that, so I will begin with a glossary of terminology for things that may make it easier to answer your questions.

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|

|Module|A module in software is a piece of software responsible for one specific functionality. In Python, they are separate files with a .py extension containing functions, classes and/or variables.|
|Package|A package in Python is a directory of packages and/or modules. It is more or less a directory with one special `__init__.py` file inside it.|
|Runtime / Environment|The runtime or environment in Python is the context in which the code runs.|
|Variable|A variable is a location that stores data temporarily within a program which can be modified, stored and/or displayed.|

|Algorithms|A set of guidelines which describe how to perform a task.|
|API|Application Programming Interface, is a structure in which you can interact with another piece of software.|
|Bug|A bug is an unexpected error which causes a malfunction.|
|Frontend|The front-end is how the user interacts with the software, like Windows.|

|List|An ordered sequence of elements, denoted with square brackets [ ]|
|Dictionary|An ordered (in 3.6+) collection of data, with a key and a value, denoted with curly brackets { }.|
|Exception|If a situation comes up that the program cannot handle, it'll throw an exception.|
|Loop|A loop allows code to be executed repeated, either with a for (finite amount of times) or while (indefinite).|
|Iteration|Repetition of a process, you iterate over a loop numerous times.|

## Editor

There is so many editors out there it is difficult to find the right one for you. 

### Mu [https://codewith.mu/](https://codewith.mu/)

Mu is a simple Python editor, designed for beginners.

## Resources

There is an abundance of resources on the internet for getting started with Python (includng this one!), these are my personal recommendations.

### Automate The Boring Stuff

[http://automatetheboringstuff.com/](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

Computers are made to do the boring things for us, so make the most of it! This book goes through many practical examples of how you can use Python to automate the boring stuff out of your life.

### Code Academy

[https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)

While the Python 3 course on Code Academy isn't free, the Python 2.7 version is and you can always learn the differences later on.

### Python Bytes Podcast

[https://pythonbytes.fm/](https://pythonbytes.fm/)

Weekly half an hour podcast on exciting packages & tools in the Python space. Great to listen to on your commute!

### Github

[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Github is a website/service where lots of open source projects & packages live. Lots of information can be found here on the projects themselves and in the issues raised/answered previously.

## Packages

The best part about Python is the community and abundance of free, open source packages that you can utilise to not re-invent the wheel when solving problems.

I did a blog post on useful packages in 2019, check it out at: [https://jackmckew.dev/episode-10-python-package-cheat-sheet.html](https://jackmckew.dev/episode-10-python-package-cheat-sheet.html)
