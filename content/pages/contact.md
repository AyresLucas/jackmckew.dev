Hey there! I’m Jack. I recently completed my bachelor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Newcastle. I like to play guitar/drums, make things, and getting in or under the water. This site is just meant to function as half blog, half showcase of a few things I like to do. Please look around, and if you’d like to contact me about anything at all, please do!
