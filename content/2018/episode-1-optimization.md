Recently I had to opportunity to optimize some workflows that involved heavy data processing, before the users were completing calculations/statistics by hand on up to 10 million rows in Excel, causing many complications (and crashes).

With the use of Python this data analysis has been reduced to a matter of seconds speeding up workflows in some cases down from a whole working day to a matter of seconds allowing users to work on more important tasks and almost eliminating risk of human error.
