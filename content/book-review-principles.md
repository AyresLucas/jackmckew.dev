# Book Review: Principles by Ray Dalio

I've just finished reading [Ray Dalio's book Principles](https://www.principles.com/), and wanted to use this space to jot down some of my personal takeaways and thoughts. To give some background, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Assosciates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, wrote this book around the unique principles that he discovered through his over forty year career that led to his and Bridgewater's success. Dalio believes that it is these principles, that are the reason behind whatever success he has had.

The book is broken into two major sections: Life Principles and Work Principles, followed by descriptions of the tools developed to work alongside the principles to help keep the concept of an idea meritocracy intact. The concept of an idea meritocracy, is where you can have a community/company in which the best idea wins, no matter who/where it came from. This is in comparison to regular company structures where the decisions come from top down, which has its pros/cons as well.
