Following the previous two weeks of topics, [Introduction to ESP32/ESP8266](https://jackmckew.dev/introduction-to-esp32-esp8266.html) and [What is MicroPython?](https://jackmckew.dev/what-is-micropython.html).  I wrote an [article on maker.pro](https://maker.pro/esp8266/tutorial/how-to-program-an-esp8266-with-micropython) in which I describe how to program the ESP8266 with MicroPython in detail.
