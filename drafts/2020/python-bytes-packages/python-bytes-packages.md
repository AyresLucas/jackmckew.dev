[Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a weekly, short & sweet podcast by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) & [Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken). After having the podcast recommended numerous times by friends & colleagues, I decided to download every episode thus far on the 14th of September 2019. Over the next 174 days, whenever I was commuting, I'd listen to 171 episodes of Python bytes, learn a stack of new things and found new amazing python packages.

This post is intended to list out the packages I'd noted down & their application.
