[`Python` Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a weekly, short & sweet podcast by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) & [Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken). After having the podcast recommended numerous times by friends & colleagues, I decided to download every episode thus far on the 14th of September 2019. Over the next 174 days, whenever I was commuting, I'd listen to 171 episodes of `Python` bytes, learn a stack of new things and found new amazing python packages.

This post is intended to list out the packages I'd noted down & their application. Total disclaimer, I haven't tried out all of these packages personally.

# Interesting Tidbits

> There was one episode that referenced some amazing examples of GUIs built in Tkinter, unfortunately I have been unable to find it again. My note that I had down was `63 GUIs in Tkinter`.

> Using --prompt to name your virtualenv for easy identification later on is something I use widely now. [https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/168/race-your-donkey-car-with-python](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/168/race-your-donkey-car-with-python)

> [Python Graph Gallery ](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) is an amazing resource for examples of already made data visualisations.

> [Type hints for busy programmers](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/11/24/type-hints-for-busy-python-programmers/) is a great resource for understanding what type hints are and why you should use them.

**Data Science**
A `Python` package for integrating CARTO maps, analysis, and data services into data science workflows.

`Python` data analysis workflows often rely on the de facto standards `pandas` and `Jupyter` notebooks. Integrating CARTO into this workflow saves data scientists time and energy by not having to export datasets as files or retain multiple copies of the data. Instead, CARTOframes give the ability to communicate reproducible analysis while providing the ability to gain from CARTO's services like hosted, dynamic or static maps and Data Observatory augmentation.

Panel works equally well in `Jupyter` Notebooks, for creating quick data-exploration tools, or as standalone deployed apps and dashboards, and allows you to easily switch between those contexts as needed.
