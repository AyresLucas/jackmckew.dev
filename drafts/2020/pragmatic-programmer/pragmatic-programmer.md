The Pragmatic Programmer is heiled as one of the must-reads for all developers and is extremely well known. It is comparable to a hand book full of tips and tricks to develop more robust software, and also introduces lots of concepts throughout that can be used to improve the development workflow as it evolves for projects. Thus here are my key takeaways, I strongly believe that this is a book you read once, learn a stack from and when you revisit it with more experience down the line, you'll learn even more.

> This review is based on the 20th anniversary edition of the book.

Most of the points below relate to specific chapters/sections.

## Soft Skills

## Know When to Stop

## DRY Principle

## Orthogonality

## Tracer Design

## Risk in Prototypes being Deployed

Specifically around when you present a prototype too soon and the user gets carried away.

## Crash Early

Check for the negatives first and throw error before running anything.

## Design by Contract

Ensure functions are only called when conditions (pre & post) are met.
