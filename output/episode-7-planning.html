<p>With 2018 coming to an end, we welcome in the new year with the first episode of Code Fridays for 2018. Continuing with the theme of things starting a new, this episode is dedicated to a major factor or stage in any type of development, planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Planning is one of the most crucial steps when beginning to tackle a project or even a problem. One of the most effective ways to deal with a problem coming from a time or financial perspective is prevention of the problem. By considering what problems may arise in a project’s lifetime, the developer or designer can implement prevention before the problem comes to fruition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Being an effective planner can help you in all walks of life. Not only can one just plan for problems that may arise in a project, one can also plan to educate themselves with the knowledge to tackle unforeseen problems within a project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>With an entire new year ahead of us all, I’d like to plan on what I’d like to learn in 2019 and in turn share what I learn with you all through this blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<ul>
<li>Containerization – integrating containerization as mentioned in Episode 6 into projects</li>
<li>Javascript – javascript is still an enigma to me at this point, I plan to work on beginner projects and hopefully integrate some of them to enhance this website</li>
<li>Developing, deploying and maintaining an Android Application – I am currently midway through developing an Android application, in future episodes I will write tutorials on how to develop certain elements with an Android application to make it more interactive</li>
<li>Big Data tools – Apache arrow and Hadoop are also new to me at this point, hoping to integrate these elements into projects that I’m currently working on</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>This is only just a small taste of what I am\
planning to cover at the very least on my weekly updates in this blog so stay\
tuned throughout the whole year!</p>
