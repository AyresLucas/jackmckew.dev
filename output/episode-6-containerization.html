<p>Recently I was researching into ways to more efficiently and effectively distribute software and I stumbled across containerization of applications. Containerization of application is when an application is run on an OS-level virtualization without spinning up an entire virtual machine for the application.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Previously the way I had been distributing software I had been developing in my preferred language (Python) was by using PyInstaller (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). However I was running into issues with distributing a single executable throughout users, although since the software was only used by a small userbase at this stage, I was able to continue to use PyInstaller. I started researching containerization as in the future the software I will be developing will be used by a larger userbase. This will hopefully be more effective at managing versions and distributing updates to said userbase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Most other professionals in the software space have been constantly mentioning the use of Docker (https://www.docker.com/), I am now integrating my projects into Docker and have had no issues thus far.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>By utilizing OS-level containerization this also allows the developer to run on any OS they wish. For multiple projects of mine, I had been intending to use influxDB (https://www.influxdata.com/), however was limited to a strictly Windows only network. I see Docker as a solution to this problem, by being able to create a linux based container to run an instance of an influxDB that can be spun up within a Windows environment and communicate back to the Windows users in the network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Lastly, I'd like to wish a happy holidays to everyone reading and will be bringing more weekly content in the new year. Please do not hesitate to comment below if there is any topics/projects that you would like for me to research and write about my findings.</p>
